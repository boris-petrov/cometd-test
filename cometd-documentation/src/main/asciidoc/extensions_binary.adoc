=== Binary Extension

The binary extension allows applications to send and receive messages containing
binary data, and therefore to upload and download binary data such as files or images.
This extension requires both a client-side extension and a server-side extension.
The server-side extension is available in Java.

==== Enabling the Server-side Extension

To enable support for binary data in messages, you must add the extension to
the `org.cometd.bayeux.server.BayeuxServer` instance during initialization:

====
[source,java]
----
bayeuxServer.addExtension(new org.cometd.server.ext.BinaryExtension());
----
====

==== Enabling the Client-side Extension

The `dojox/cometd/binary.js` provides the client-side extension binding for
Dojo, and it is sufficient to use Dojo's `dojo.require` mechanism:

====
[source,javascript]
----
require(["dojox/cometd", "dojox/cometd/binary"], function(cometd) {
    ...
});
----
====

The example above is valid also when using the `require()` syntax with jQuery.

The file `jquery.cometd-binary.js` provides the client-side extension
binding for jQuery.
When you are not using the `require()` syntax, you must include the
implementation file and the jQuery extension binding
in the HTML page via the `<script>` tag:

====
[source,javascript]
----
<script type="text/javascript" src="BinaryExtension.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.cometd-timestamp.js"></script>
----
====

In both Dojo and jQuery extension bindings, the extension is registered on
the default `cometd` object under the name "binary".

For Java clients, you must add the extension to the `BayeuxClient` instance:

====
[source,java]
----
BayeuxClient bayeuxClient = ...;
bayeuxClient.addExtension(new org.cometd.client.ext.BinaryExtension());
----
====
