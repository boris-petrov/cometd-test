==== Using Services

A CometD _service_ is a Java class that allows a developer to specify the code
to run when Bayeux channels receive Bayeux messages.
When a message arrives on a channel to which the service instance subscribes,
CometD invokes a callback method to execute user-specific code.

CometD services can be of two kinds:

* <<_java_server_services_inherited,inherited>>
* <<_java_server_services_annotated,annotated>>

You can also integrate CometD services with the Spring Framework as explained
in <<_java_server_services_integration_spring,the Spring Framework integration section>>.
