== Building

=== Requirements

Building the CometD project has 2 minimum requirements:

* http://java.sun.com[JDK 8] or greater, to compile the Java code
* http://maven.apache.org[Maven 3] or greater, the build tool

Make sure that the `mvn` executable is in your path, and that your `JAVA_HOME`
environment variable points to the directory where Java is installed.

=== Obtaining the source code

You can obtain the source code from either the distribution tarball or by
checking out the source from the GitHub repository.

If you want to use the distribution tarball, download it from
http://download.cometd.org/[here], then unpack it with the following commands:

----
$ tar zxvf cometd-<version>-distribution.tar.gz
$ cd cometd-<version>
----

If you want to use the latest code, clone the GitHub repository with the following commands:

----
$ git clone git://github.com/cometd/cometd.git cometd
$ cd cometd
$ git checkout 4.0.x
----

=== Performing the Build

Once you have obtained the source code, you need to issue the following command to build it:

----
$ mvn clean install
----

If you want to save some time, you can skip the execution of the test suite using the following command:

----
$ mvn clean install -DskipTests
----

=== Trying out your Build

To try out your build just follow these steps (after having built following the above instructions):

----
$ cd cometd-demo
$ mvn jetty:run
----

Then point your browser at http://localhost:8080 and you should see the CometD Demo page.
