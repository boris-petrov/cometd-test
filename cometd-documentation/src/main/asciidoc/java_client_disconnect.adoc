==== Disconnecting

Disconnecting is straightforward:

====
[source,java]
----
BayeuxClient client = ...;
client.disconnect();
----
====

Like the other APIs, you can pass a callback `MessageListener` to be notified
that the server received and processed the disconnect request:

====
[source,java]
----
BayeuxClient client = ...;
client.disconnect(message -> {
    if (message.isSuccessful()) {
        // Server processed the disconnect request.
    }
});
----
====

Alternatively, you can block and wait for the disconnect to complete:

====
[source,java]
----
BayeuxClient client = ...;
client.disconnect();
client.waitFor(1000, BayeuxClient.State.DISCONNECTED);
----
