== Preface

http://cometd.org/[CometD] is a scalable web event routing bus that allows you
to write low-latency, server-side, event-driven web applications.
Typical examples of such applications are stock trading applications, web chat
applications, online games, and monitoring consoles.

CometD provides you APIs to implement these messaging patterns: publish/subscribe,
peer-to-peer (via a server), and remote procedure call.
This is achieved using a transport-independent protocol,
<<_bayeux,the Bayeux protocol>>, that can be carried over HTTP or
over http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket[WebSocket] (or other transport
protocols), so that your application is not bound to a specific transport
technology.

CometD leverages WebSocket when it can (because it's the most
efficient web messaging protocol), and makes use of an
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX[Ajax] push technology
pattern known as http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_(programming)[Comet]
when using HTTP.

The CometD project provides Java and JavaScript libraries that allow you to
write low-latency, server-side, event-driven web applications in a simple and
portable way.
You can therefore concentrate on the business side of your application rather
than worrying about low-level details such as the transport (HTTP or WebSocket),
the scalability and the robustness.
The CometD libraries provide these latter characteristics. 

If you are new to CometD, you can follow this learning path: 

. Read <<_installation,the installation section>> to download, install CometD and to try out its demos.
. Read <<_primer,the primer section>> to get your hands dirty with CometD with a step-by-step tutorial.
. Read <<_concepts,the concepts section>> to understand the abstractions that CometD defines.
. Study the CometD demos that ship with the CometD distribution . 
. Read the rest of this reference book for further details.

You can contribute to the CometD project and be involved in the CometD community,
including:

* Trying it out and reporting issues at http://bugs.cometd.org
* Participating in the http://groups.google.com/group/cometd-users/[CometD Users]
and http://groups.google.com/group/cometd-dev/[CometD Development] mailing lists.
* Helping out with the documentation by contacting the mailing lists or by reporting issues.
* Spreading the word about CometD in your organization.
