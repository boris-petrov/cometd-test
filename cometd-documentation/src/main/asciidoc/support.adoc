== CometD Commercial Support Services

The services provided are provided directly by the CometD committers, ensuring the maximum result.

* CometD training for your developers. +
  Training includes tips and tricks, experience gained by developing CometD
  applications over the years and much more.
* Development of proof-of-concept applications. +
  We can develop these much quicker than developers not well experienced in
  CometD.
* Development of an application framework tailored for your needs. +
  Your developers can concentrate more on the implementation of the application
  rather than on CometD details.
* Development of custom CometD features. +
  Nothing like real-world use cases to improve an open source project like CometD.
* CometD advices to your developers. +
  Your development team has direct access to CometD experts to ask questions or
  opinions, so that mistakes are caught early when they cost less rather than
  later when they will cost a lot more.
* CometD applications review. +
  If you have already developed your CometD application, we can review it and
  suggest fixes or improvements to make it better.
* CometD performance tuning. +
  If your CometD application scales only up to a certain point, we can review
  its performance and suggest the best changes to apply to make it scale better.
* CometD clustering review. +
  If you need to scale horizontally, CometD provides a scalability cluster, see
  <<_java_oort,the Oort section>>.
  Clustering is never easy, but we can suggest the right approach to make your
  application clusterable.
* Any other CometD-related service that you may need, we can provide it.
