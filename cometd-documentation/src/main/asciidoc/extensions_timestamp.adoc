=== Timestamp Extension

The timestamp extension adds a `timestamp` to the message object for every
message the client and/or server sends.
It is a non-standard extension because it does not add the additional fields
to the `ext` field, but to the message object itself.
This extension requires both a client-side extension and a server-side extension.
The server-side extension is available in Java.

==== Enabling the Server-side Extension

To enable support for time-stamped messages, you must add the extension to
the `org.cometd.bayeux.server.BayeuxServer` instance during initialization:

====
[source,java]
----
bayeuxServer.addExtension(new org.cometd.server.ext.TimestampExtension());
----
====

==== Enabling the Client-side Extension

The `dojox/cometd/timestamp.js` provides the client-side extension binding for
Dojo, and it is sufficient to use Dojo's `dojo.require` mechanism:

====
[source,javascript]
----
require(["dojox/cometd", "dojox/cometd/timestamp"], function(cometd) {
    ...
});
----
====

The example above is valid also when using the `require()` syntax with jQuery.

The file `jquery.cometd-timestamp.js` provides the client-side extension
binding for jQuery.
When you are not using the `require()` syntax, you must include the
implementation file and the jQuery extension binding
in the HTML page via the `<script>` tag:

====
[source,javascript]
----
<script type="text/javascript" src="TimeStampExtension.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.cometd-timestamp.js"></script>
----
====

In both Dojo and jQuery extension bindings, the extension is registered on
the default `cometd` object under the name "timestamp".
