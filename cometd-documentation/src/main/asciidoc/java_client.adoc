=== Client Library

You can use the CometD client implementation in any JSE(TM) or JEE(TM) application.
It consists of one main class, `org.cometd.client.BayeuxClient`, which
implements the `org.cometd.bayeux.client.ClientSession` interface.

Typical uses of the CometD Java client include:

* The transport for a rich thick Java UI (for example, Swing or Android) to communicate
  to a Bayeux Server (also via firewalls).
* A load generator to simulate thousands of CometD clients, for example
  `org.cometd.benchmark.client.CometDLoadClient`

The following sections provide details about the Java `BayeuxClient` APIs and their
implementation secrets.
